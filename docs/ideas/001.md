Write a CLI tool called `env diff` that compares multiple `.env` files and highlights differences in environment variable names and values.

Requirements:
1. The command should scan multiple `.env` files in the current directory or specified via command line arguments --dir or -d. 
    Scan all `.env` files if no arguments are provided.
    For example: .env.dev, .env.staging, .env.prod, local.env, staging.env, prod.env, etc.

2. Parse `.env` files (format: KEY=VALUE, ignore comments and empty lines).
3. Load each file into a `Map<String, String>` keyed by variable name.
4. Compare across environments:
   - Detect variables missing in some environments.
   - Detect variables with different values across environments.
   - Detect extra variables.
5. Print results in a clear table format:
   - Columns = environment filenames
   - Rows = variable names
   - Mark matching entries with `OK`.
   - Mark missing entries with `MISSING`.
   - Mark differences with `DIFF`.
6. Return exit code:
   - 0 if all environments match perfectly.
   - 1 if any differences are found.
7. Add options:
   - `--csv` to output differences as CSV.
   - `--color` to enable colored output (red = missing, yellow = diff, green = match).
