# 📌 Roadmap

The **Scaffolder CLI** project aims to evolve from a simple project initializer into a powerful scaffolding ecosystem for developers.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1 – MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

* [ ] Generate **README.md** and **LICENSE** (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL)
* [ ] Support basic multi-language scaffolding: **Rust**, **Go**, **Python**
* [ ] **Config profiles** (`~/.skel/config.yml`) for author, email, default license
* [ ] Auto `git init` + initial commit

👉 **Goal**: Quickly create a ready-to-use project with a standard structure.

---

## ⚡ Phase 2 – Developer Experience

* [ ] **Custom templates**: Allow defining `.ftl` in `~/.skel/templates/`
* [ ] Generate **.gitignore** & **.editorconfig** per language
* [ ] **CI/CD templates**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkinsfile
* [ ] **Interactive mode** (`--interactive`) to input project name, author, license


👉 **Goal**: Developers can scaffold projects tailored to their personal or company standards.

---

## 🔥 Phase 3 – Advanced Features

* [ ] **Template plugin system** (load templates from GitHub/GitLab repos)
* [ ] **Changelog & Conventional Commits integration**
* [ ] **Release automation hooks** (generate changelog, bump version)
* [ ] **REST API / Service Mode** to expose scaffolder via HTTP

👉 **Goal**: The tool becomes an extensible **ecosystem**, not just a CLI.

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 – Community & Ecosystem

* [ ] **Templates registry** (like npm, but for scaffolder templates)
* [ ] **CLI plugin marketplace** to share community templates
* [ ] Support additional stacks: **Java Spring Boot, Kotlin, Angular, React, Vue, Next.js…**

👉 **Goal**: Become a **standard scaffolding ecosystem** across multiple stacks.
