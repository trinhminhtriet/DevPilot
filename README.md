## Intro

**DevPilot** is a command-line tool built with **Spring Boot**, **Picocli**, and **Freemarker**.  
It helps developers quickly generate project scaffolding for multiple languages such as **Rust**, **Golang**, **Python**, and **TypeScript**, including essential files like `README.md`, `LICENSE`,
`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.vscode/settings.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.

The goal of this project is to provide a unified, extensible CLI tool for initializing projects with
best practices and templates.
